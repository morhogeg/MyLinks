## 1. What Machina is

**Machina AI** (`com.morhogeg.machina`) — an AI-powered personal knowledge base.
Capture a link/image from anywhere (iOS share sheet, WhatsApp, web UI, browser
extension) → Python Cloud Function scrapes + Gemini analyzes → a structured card
(summary, category, tags, concepts, embedding, related links) lands in a real-time
feed with semantic search, RAG chat ("Ask Machina"), spaced-repetition reminders,
curated digests, weekly AI synthesis, and collections.

**Positioning (from the product review):** the hero is the **Recall Engine** —
"ask your own knowledge and get a cited answer" — backed by the widest capture
surface in the category and a knowledge graph computed on every save. The path to
"Apple would ship this" is subtraction, trust, and focus — not more features.

**Product grade trajectory:** review scored it ~7.5/10 (2026-07-01). Phase 1
(trust + name) and Phase 2 (reveal the magic + cut sprawl) of the product spec are
**done** (see §4.9). Phase 3 differentiators are not started.

## 2. Architecture & stack

- **Frontend:** Next.js 16 + React 19 + Tailwind v4 in `web/`. Static export for
  Firebase Hosting + Capacitor; native Next build on Vercel (`VERCEL=1` disables
  export). Theme tokens (`text-text`, `bg-card`, `--accent-gradient`…) — never
  hardcode white/black. Easing tokens: `--ease-modal` (all modals), `--ease-spring`
  (card grid only).
- **iOS app:** Capacitor 8 shell (`web/ios/`, SPM, no CocoaPods) + native **Share
  Extension** (`web/ios/App/ShareExt/`) that authenticates via an ingest token
  bridged through App Group `group.com.morhogeg.machina`
  (`ShareConfigPlugin.swift`). Plugins: haptics, share (+ firebase-authentication,
  currently stripped in CI — see task 1). Team `8Y2M94RUHG`.
- **Backend:** Python 3.13 Firebase Cloud Functions in `functions/` (project
  **`secondbrain-app-94da2`**, us-central1). Gemini `gemini-3.1-flash-lite`
  (analysis/vision, centralized in `GEMINI_ANALYSIS_MODEL`), `gemini-embedding-001`
  (search). Twilio (WhatsApp). SendGrid/SMTP (email digests — not yet configured).
- **Data:** Firestore `users/{uid}/…` where **uid = phone number** (e.g.
  `+1646…`); Google/Apple accounts link via `authUids[]` on the user doc (no data
  migration — see `AUTH_SPEC.md`). Subcollections: `links`, `chats`, `collections`,
  `syntheses`. Public snapshots: `shared_cards`, `shared_collections`.
- **Deploy surfaces:**
  - **Desktop web** → Vercel (`my-links-sable.vercel.app`), auto on push to `main`,
    Root Directory = `web`.
  - **iOS app** → GitHub Actions **"iOS → TestFlight"** workflow
    (`.github/workflows/ios-testflight.yml`, macOS runner, cloud-managed signing,
    build number = 1000 + run number). Manual dispatch only during the auth
    cutover. Run #6 (2026-07-02) is **green** and uploaded a UI-only build.
  - **Firebase Hosting** (`secondbrain-app-94da2.web.app`) — no longer a user-facing
    deploy target (the iPhone PWA is retired in favor of the native app), but the
    origin still matters: it serves the `/api/*` rewrites the native app calls
    (`NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE`) and the `/s`, `/c` share pages (`share_page` function).
    Redeploy hosting only when `firebase.json` rewrites change.
  - **Functions** → `./deploy-functions.sh functions:<a>,functions:<b>` (always
    pass explicit targets; scheduler/webhook fns aren't in the default set).

### Operational gotchas (hard-won — don't re-learn these)

- `GEMINI_API_KEY` and `TWILIO_*` are **plain env vars in `functions/.env`**
  (gitignored) — NOT Secret Manager secrets; binding them as secrets breaks deploy.
  Functions deploy needs a local venv (`cd functions && python3.13 -m venv venv &&
  venv/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt`) so firebase-tools can import the source.
- `deploy-functions.sh` pins `--project secondbrain-app-94da2` (a `firebase use`
  override once sent deploys to the wrong project) and auto-prefixes `functions:`.
- `process_link_background` (Firestore-trigger fn) sometimes 409s on deploy —
  retry in ~60s.
- `web/lib/firebase.ts` WebView fixes (don't reintroduce): `initializeAuth`
  without the popup resolver (gapi crashes under `capacitor://`),
  `experimentalForceLongPolling` for Firestore, emulator gate requires
  `localhost` + `http:` (so `http://127.0.0.1:3000` previews against prod data).
- CORS allowlist in `functions/main.py` `_allowed_origins()` must include
  `capacitor://localhost` (+ `ionic://`, `https://localhost`) or every native
  `/api/*` call fails with a bare "Load failed".
- SSE is buffered in WKWebView — native Ask uses buffered JSON
  (`wantStream = !isNativeApp()`); `/api/chat` bypasses Hosting via
  `web/app/api/chat/route.ts` → the function's direct URL.
- Web builds self-host fonts (`geist` package) so builds never fetch Google Fonts.
- Cloud sessions can't reach `*.run.app` URLs (egress allowlist) — verify deployed
  functions via the app, not curl.
- Frontend check: `cd web && npx tsc --noEmit`. Backend: `cd functions &&
  python -m py_compile *.py`.

## 3. Auth — exact current state (the thing everything gates on)

The multi-user auth work is **fully written but not live**:

- **Code done:** Google + Apple sign-in on web and native (`web/lib/auth.ts`,
  `@capacitor-firebase/authentication@^8.3.0`), `AuthProvider` gating both
  platforms, backend ID-token verification (`_verify_bearer`/`_authed_uid` on all
  data endpoints), `claim_workspace` + `delete_account` callables, locked ruleset
  staged in `firestore.rules.locked`, `PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy` for both targets,
  Sign in with Apple entitlement.
- **Flag-gated OFF:** `REQUIRE_AUTH` (functions) / `NEXT_PUBLIC_REQUIRE_AUTH`
  (web) are unset → live behavior is still web-Google-gate + native
  first-user-doc + backend trusting client `uid`.
- **Live `firestore.rules` are still `allow read, write: if true`.**
- **CI blocker:** adding the firebase-auth plugin makes SPM resolve a
  `capacitor-swift-pm` incompatible with `@capacitor/share@8.0.1`
  (`CAPPluginCall has no member 'reject'`). CI currently `sed`-strips the plugin
  (UI-only builds). Fix = align the Capacitor/SPM version set, then revert the
  strip. Cutover order (do not deviate): `NATIVE_AUTH_SETUP.md`.

## 4. THE BACKLOG — ranked, most urgent → least

> Verified against code 2026-07-03. "Done" claims below were checked, not copied.
> Rank = (blocks launch) > (App Store hard requirement) > (security/cost exposure)
> > (product quality) > (growth/differentiators).

### 🔴 P0 — launch blockers (in order)

1. **[ ] Native auth build green (iOS).** Fix the `capacitor-swift-pm` /
   `@capacitor/share` version conflict, remove the CI `sed` strip of
   `CapacitorFirebaseAuthentication` in `ios-testflight.yml`, get a TestFlight
   build with working native Apple + Google sign-in. Needs CI iteration on macOS.
   (Was `HANDOFF-iOS-AUTH.md` steps 1–2.)
2. **[ ] Auth cutover.** After 1 is verified on device: flip `REQUIRE_AUTH` +
   `NEXT_PUBLIC_REQUIRE_AUTH`, redeploy functions + web, test the locked rules in
   the emulator, then `cp firestore.rules.locked firestore.rules && firebase
   deploy --only firestore:rules`. Closes audit blockers B-1/B-2/B-3. Steps:
   `NATIVE_AUTH_SETUP.md` §6.
3. **[x] New-user path** *(code done 2026-07-03; goes live with the task-2
   cutover — flag-gated behind `REQUIRE_AUTH`).* `claim_workspace` now falls
   back to creating a fresh `users/{authUid}` workspace (authUids/email/
   createdAt/default settings + ingest token) for any verified account that
   can't claim the OWNER_EMAIL-gated legacy doc; the web app shows a one-screen
   welcome (`web/components/Onboarding.tsx`, dismissal on the user doc
   `onboarded` + localStorage fallback) instead of the restricted screen, which
   now remains only for creation failures (with a Retry). Example-card seeding
   was skipped (optional). Ships with the task-2 functions deploy — no separate
   action.
4. **[ ] Pending deploys/verifications from the last sessions** (owner machine):
   - `./deploy-functions.sh` — M12 weekly synthesis backend is written but dark.
   - `firebase deploy --only firestore:rules` — the `syntheses` read rule.
   - Run the M9 backfill once: `curl .../backfill_related_links` (idempotent).
   - Confirm `backfill_youtube_channels` was run (channel-name repair).
   - `/api/analyze` 60s timeout on slow YouTube videos — route around Hosting's
     60s cap like `/api/chat` did (touches all link-saving; test carefully).
5. **[ ] Security config + key hygiene (30 min, do with #2):** set `ADMIN_TOKEN`,
   `APPCHECK_ENFORCE=true`, `OWNER_EMAIL` in functions env. **Rotate the Gemini
   key** (was pasted in chat 2026-06-23) and the **App Store Connect API `.p8`**
   (pasted in plaintext during CI setup).

### 🟠 P1 — App Store submission requirements (see §6 for the full readiness review)

6. **[ ] AI-consent disclosure (Guideline 5.1.1/5.1.2 as updated Nov 2025).**
   Apps sending personal data to third-party AI must name the provider and get
   explicit consent. Machina sends saved URLs/images/questions to **Google
   Gemini**. Add a first-run consent screen + a line in Settings; cover it in the
   privacy policy. *New requirement — not in the old audit.*
7. **[ ] Privacy manifests wired into both Xcode targets.** The two
   `PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy` files exist but must be added to Copy Bundle Resources
   in Xcode (App + ShareExt) — audit B-4's remaining manual step. Verify in the
   next archive.
8. **[ ] Privacy policy + Terms URLs, App Privacy "nutrition label", App Store
   metadata.** Host a privacy policy (list: Google account data, saved content in
   Firebase, Gemini processing, WhatsApp phone number if used); link it in-app
   (Settings) and in App Store Connect. Fill the data-collection declarations.
   Screenshots, description, keywords (§8 has drafts).
9. **[ ] Reviewer readiness.** Demo account credentials for App Review (auth will
   be ON), review notes explaining WhatsApp capture (reviewer can't test Twilio),
   and either iPad screenshots or set `TARGETED_DEVICE_FAMILY = 1` (currently
   `"1,2"` = universal — iPhone-only is the cheaper path).
10. **[ ] CI SDK check.** Apple requires builds against the current-generation
    SDK (Xcode 26 era rule took effect April 2026); CI selects `Xcode_16*` on
    `macos-14`. The 2026-07-02 upload succeeded, but verify TestFlight processing
    didn't warn, and move to the latest runner/Xcode before App Store submission.
11. **[ ] On-device verification sweep** (can't be done headlessly, one pass on a
    physical iPhone): share-ext neutral "still saving" state under killed network
    (never a false green check); haptics on favorite/delete/save/PTR/confirm;
    keyboard never covers inputs (LinkDetailModal category/tag, AddToCollection,
    AddLinkForm on iPhone SE); pull-to-refresh vs edge-swipe conflicts; failed
    card → Retry; Apple + Google sign-in; account deletion end-to-end.

### 🟡 P2 — security/cost hardening & honest product surface

12. **[ ] Ingest token hardening (audit H-1).** Move from App Group UserDefaults
    to Keychain; server copy to a functions-only collection; add rotation.
13. **[ ] Remaining audit mediums:** per-uid rate limits post-auth + fail-closed
    on paid buckets (M-3), cap `ask_brain` history (M-5), mask remaining phone
    logs in `link_service.py`/`whatsapp_handler.py` (H-4 residue).
14. **[ ] README ↔ reality (M-P5/T12) — still false.** Verified 2026-07-03: README
    claims Graph *Visualization*, Insights Dashboard, "Works Offline", Table view —
    none exist. Rewrite to describe the real product (recall engine, capture
    surface, synthesis). Also remove the PWA badge/positioning.
15. **[ ] Retire the iPhone-PWA surface deliberately.** The native app replaced
    it: remove `InstallPWA.tsx` (or gate to Android only), stop advertising
    install-to-home-screen, and stop routine `./deploy-hosting.sh` runs (already
    removed from the ship skill). Keep Hosting alive solely for `/api/*` rewrites +
    share pages.
16. **[ ] Offline decision (M15).** No service worker exists. Either build
    read-cache offline for opened articles or (cheaper) drop every offline claim
    (fold into 14).
17. **[ ] Light theme decision (M-P1).** Give light mode the dark theme's material
    care, or ship dark-only intentionally. Decide, don't leave half-done.
18. **[ ] Test harness (T3).** Only `functions/test_yt_scrape.py` exists. Add
    scraper fixtures, `ai_service` schema-contract tests, `search.py` tests,
    WhatsApp payload smoke test; wire into CI/SessionStart.
19. **[ ] Cost guardrails.** Budget alerts on the Firebase/GCP project; per-user
    monthly quotas (see §7); email digest provider decision (SendGrid key or cut
    the email channel).

### 🟢 P3 — product roadmap (post-launch)

20. **[ ] M17 Voice capture + voice ask** (mic in AskBrain; WKWebView speech quirks).
21. **[ ] M18 Proactive brain** (contradiction/reinforcement observations; needs push notifications — also not implemented).
22. **[ ] M19 Shareable cited answers** (growth surface; `share_page` backend exists).
23. **[ ] M20 Auto-collections** (cluster `concepts`/embeddings into suggested collections).
24. **[ ] T10 export** (MD/PDF/HTML from ReadingView), **T11 highlights**, T5/T6
    connector framework + YouTube liked-videos sync (pull connectors; IG/FB saved
    have no legitimate API — won't do), Chrome Web Store listing for the extension.
25. **[ ] QA backlog leftovers** (from the F-series, still open): F-16 ref-counted
    scroll locks, F-20 ReminderModal past-times/date-rollover, F-21 offline signal
    for optimistic writes, F-24/25/26 SimpleMarkdown + RTL unification, F-29
    SwipeDeck undo doesn't cancel reminders, F-31 Reader "Listen" reliability,
    F-32 SwipeDeck stale snapshot, L-5 unbounded `deleteCollection` batch.

### ✅ Done — verified against code (do not redo)

- **Product spec Phases 1–2 complete:** M1 (one name), M2 (share-ext never lies),
  M3 (processing→ready|failed lifecycle + Retry), M4 (deep-link opens once), M5
  (visual-viewport everywhere), M6 (honest progress), M7 (settings dirty-guard),
  M9 (See also + backfill fn), M10 (connection insights), M11 (haptics), M12
  (weekly synthesis — code; deploy pending, task 4), M13 (Compact cut), M14
  (option sprawl trimmed), M16 (pull-to-refresh), M-P2/P3/P4 (motion/targets/timing).
- **Auth code complete** (M8/T1 = audit B-1/B-2/B-3/B-5/B-7): native+web
  Google/Apple sign-in, token-verified backend, account deletion, locked rules
  staged — **cutover pending** (tasks 1–2).
- **Audit Batch 1:** SSRF redirect guard, PII log scrubbing (main.py), Twilio
  fail-closed, fetch timeouts, admin-token-gated debug endpoints, noopener,
  URL-scheme guards, sanitized errors, privacy manifest files created.
- **Capture surface:** Share Extension (links/text/images + scan HUD), WhatsApp
  (EN/HE + digest commands), web add/image, browser extension (`/extension`,
  Chrome/Edge/Brave + Safari converter), iOS Shortcut (legacy, still works).
- **Recall:** Ask Machina (hybrid RAG, streaming on web, chat history), semantic
  search, reminders, curated digest (6 modes), weekly synthesis, collections +
  public share pages (server-rendered OG), reading view + TTS.
- **CI:** iOS → TestFlight workflow green (UI-only build 1006, 2026-07-02);
  secrets configured; cloud-managed signing works.
- **T15 polish pass, T2 pipeline consolidation** (Python canonical; TS routes are
  thin proxies), **T9 extension**, **T14 share capture** — shipped.

## 5. Ship checklist (what the `/ship` skill automates)

1. Scope the diff (`web/`? `functions/`? docs-only?).
2. Typecheck web + `py_compile` functions.
3. Merge to `main`, push → **Vercel auto-deploys desktop**.
4. Backend changed → `./deploy-functions.sh functions:<explicit,targets>`.
5. App changed → trigger **"iOS → TestFlight"** GitHub Actions workflow (manual
   dispatch; auto-trigger re-enables after the auth cutover).
6. `firebase.json` rewrites changed → `./deploy-hosting.sh` (otherwise skip —
   the iPhone PWA is retired).
7. Update **this document** (§4 checkboxes + §9 session log).

## 6. Episode 1 — Codebase readiness for App Store iOS submission (reviewed 2026-07-03)

The engineering fundamentals are in better shape than most first submissions: the
audit's hard blockers were all addressed in code — in-app account deletion
(Guideline 5.1.1(v)) exists as a `delete_account` callable with a confirm flow,
Sign in with Apple ships alongside Google (Guideline 4.8), privacy manifest files
with the correct `CA92.1` UserDefaults declarations exist for both the app and the
Share Extension (the post-2024 auto-rejection trap), `ITSAppUsesNonExemptEncryption`
is set, ATS is clean, there's no tracking SDK (so no ATT prompt needed), and the
app comfortably clears Guideline 4.2 "minimum functionality" — a native share
extension, haptics, and real offline-tolerant plumbing make it feel like an app,
not a wrapped website. The genuine gap between today and a submittable build is
concentrated in one place: **auth isn't live**. The store build must be the one
where `REQUIRE_AUTH` is on, Firestore rules are locked, and a reviewer can create
a fresh account — because a reviewer landing in the current shared single-user
workspace (or on a "restricted access" screen) is an instant rejection, and
world-writable rules on a public app are a data breach, not a finding.

Beyond auth, current-cycle guideline changes add three items the older audit
predates. First, Apple's **AI transparency enforcement (November 2025)**: an app
that sends personal data to a third-party AI service must disclose the provider
and obtain explicit consent — Machina sends saved content, images, and questions
to Google Gemini, so a first-run consent notice plus a privacy-policy section
naming Gemini is now table stakes. Second, the **SDK floor**: since April 2026
submissions must be built against the current-generation SDK, and the CI pins
`Xcode_16*` on `macos-14` — bump the runner before the store submission even
though TestFlight accepted the July 2 build. Third, review logistics: a **demo
account** in App Review notes, an explanation that WhatsApp capture requires an
external Twilio number (so the reviewer doesn't fail it as broken), a hosted
**privacy policy + support URL**, the App Privacy nutrition label matching
Firebase + Google Sign-In data collection, and either iPad screenshots or flipping
`TARGETED_DEVICE_FAMILY` from `"1,2"` to iPhone-only (recommended — the UI is
phone-first). None of these are engineering-heavy; they are a focused week once
the auth build is green. Realistic sequence: CI plugin fix → cutover → consent
screen + policy URLs → device pass (§4 task 11) → submit.

## 7. Episode 2 — Cost, API keys, and the user journey

**Do not ask users for an API key.** BYO-key is the single worst option for this
product: it filters the audience down to developers, adds a brutal first-run
(sign up at Google AI Studio before saving your first link?), creates support
burden, and — because the key would have to live client-side or per-user
server-side — weakens the security posture the audit worked to fix. The key stays
where it is today: **server-side only, in Cloud Functions env**, never in the
bundle (the client-side Gemini path was already deleted for exactly this reason).
The economics support this: analysis runs on `gemini-3.1-flash-lite`, one of the
cheapest capable models — a typical save (scrape + structured analysis + embedding
+ graph check) costs a fraction of a cent, and even a heavy user (300 saves + 100
asks + digests/syntheses a month) lands in the range of **$0.10–$0.50/month** in
model cost plus Firebase's mostly-free tier. Cost is not the constraint; **abuse**
is. The real protections are already designed: verified auth on every paid
endpoint (task 2), App Check enforcement, and per-uid rate limits (task 13) — plus
GCP budget alerts (task 19) so a surprise never compounds.

**Recommended course: launch free with invisible guardrails, monetize with a
simple subscription only after retention proves itself.** Concretely: (1) at
launch, everything free with generous soft caps enforced server-side (e.g. ~150
saves and ~100 asks/month — above what an engaged user hits, so nobody ever sees
the limit in month one); (2) when there's evidence people return (the weekly
synthesis and digest are the retention signals to watch), introduce **Machina
Pro** via Apple In-App Purchase at ~$3.99/month or $29/year — unlimited saves and
asks, weekly synthesis, voice ask when it ships, priority analysis — keeping the
free tier genuinely useful (the free tier IS the marketing); (3) never gate
capture — a save that bounces off a paywall destroys the "I can trust this caught
it" promise the whole product stands on; gate the expensive *intelligence*
(unlimited Ask, synthesis) instead. Use Apple IAP/StoreKit rather than external
purchase links at this scale: the 15% small-business rate costs less than the
conversion you'd lose sending iOS users to a web checkout, and it keeps review
friction near zero. On the user's side of the ledger the journey is: install →
sign in with Apple → consent to AI processing → save two things from the share
sheet → magic, with zero setup and zero payment wall — convenience first, and the
costs it creates for you are cents, bounded, and observable.

## 8. Episode 3 — Marketing plan (≈$0 budget) + launch assets

**Strategy.** Machina's growth loop is built into the product: every shared card
and cited answer is a public, OG-rendered page that links back to the app — the
marketing job is to get those artifacts in front of the right feeds. Budget: $0
on ads at launch. The one paid channel worth considering *later* is Apple Search
Ads on exact-match keywords ("second brain", "save for later ai") with a hard
$5–10/day cap — nothing else (X ads, Meta) makes sense at this stage. The plan is
sequenced: (1) **Build-in-public on X** starting now — 2–3 posts/week showing real
moments (a weekly synthesis screenshot, an Ask answer with citations, the share
sheet catching a recipe from WhatsApp); this compounds and costs nothing but is
the slowest, so it starts first. (2) **TestFlight open beta** with a public link
posted to X + r/PKMS + r/ObsidianMD-adjacent communities and Hacker News "Show
HN" — beta feedback doubles as testimonials. (3) **Launch week:** Product Hunt
launch (Tuesday–Thursday), a Show HN, an X thread, and a 30-second screen-recorded
demo (share → analyzed card → ask → cited answer) reused everywhere including
TikTok/Reels/Shorts — short-form screen demos of "I asked my bookmarks a question
and it answered with sources" are exactly what performs organically in the
productivity niche. (4) **Ongoing:** App Store Optimization (title "Machina AI —
Ask Your Saves"; keywords: second brain, read later, bookmark manager, AI
summary, save links, knowledge base), and a monthly public "what Machina learned
this month" post generated from the actual synthesis feature — the product
markets itself if you publish what it produces. Success metric for month one:
1,000 installs, 20% week-2 retention, 50 organic shares — retention gates any
paid spend.

**Launch assets — first set (ready to adapt):**

*Announcement thread (X), post 1:*
> I kept saving links I never looked at again. Bookmarks, WhatsApp self-messages,
> screenshots — a graveyard.
>
> So I built Machina: share anything to it, AI reads it, and later you just *ask*.
> "What did I save about mortgage rates?" → answer, with sources.
>
> Out now on iOS 🧵

*Post 2:*
> Every save gets: a real summary, category, tags, and — the part I love —
> connections. "3 things you saved connect to Network Effects."
>
> It's not a bookmark manager. It's memory. [screenshot: connection insight]

*Post 3:*
> Sunday it sends a synthesis of your week's saves — themes, one standout, an
> open question. Written from YOUR content, cited back to it.
>
> This is the screenshot I keep sending friends: [screenshot: weekly synthesis]

*Post 4 (CTA):*
> Free on the App Store. Save from the share sheet, WhatsApp, or your browser.
> Ask it anything you've saved.
>
> [App Store link] — reply with what you'd ask your bookmarks 👇

*Show HN:*
> **Show HN: Machina — save links from anywhere, then ask them questions (RAG
> over your own saves)** — iOS app + web. Native share extension → Gemini
> analysis → embeddings in Firestore → cited answers. Built solo; the interesting
> parts were making the share extension never lie about saving, and a knowledge
> graph computed on every save. Happy to answer questions on the stack.

*Product Hunt:* tagline "**Ask your bookmarks anything**"; first comment covers
the origin story (WhatsApp self-messages), the capture surface, and the free tier.

*App Store subtitle/promo:* "Save from anywhere. Ask it anything." / promo text:
"Machina reads everything you save — links, screenshots, videos — and answers
questions from it, with sources."

*Where to "advertise" for free:* X (primary), Product Hunt, Hacker News,
r/PKMS + r/productivity (follow self-promo rules: give value first), Indie
Hackers, a launch post on LinkedIn (the productivity-tools audience there is
underrated and free). Paid, only after retention proves out: Apple Search Ads
exact-match, capped.

## 9. Session log

> One short paragraph per session, newest first. Detail lives in git history and
> PR descriptions — this is the orientation trail, not a changelog.

- **2026-07-03 — New-user path (§4 task 3).** `claim_workspace` extended:
  claim (OWNER_EMAIL-gated) → create-fresh-workspace fallback
  (`link_service.create_workspace`, doc ID = Firebase Auth uid, default
  settings + ingest token, `onboarded: false`); returns `created` so the
  client shows the new one-screen `Onboarding.tsx` welcome (capture surfaces +
  "Start saving"). Restricted screen kept only for failures, now with Retry.
  Fully flag-gated: with `REQUIRE_AUTH` off nothing changes live.
- **2026-07-03 — Auth-cutover readiness (code side of §4 task 2).** Brought
  `firestore.rules.locked` up to date: added the missing `syntheses` rule
  (client read-only), rewrote the `users/{uid}` read rule to be
  `resource.data.authUids`-based (the old `owns(uid)` `get()` can't run in a
  *list* rule, so it would have rejected the workspace-resolve query and
  bricked every sign-in at cutover), denied client create/delete on user docs.
  Added `firestore-rules-test/` (rules-unit-testing suite + README; couldn't
  run in the cloud session — emulator JAR download blocked — run it on the
  owner machine). Flag audit: `retryFailedLink` (web/lib/storage.ts) misses
  `authHeaders()` → card Retry 401s under `REQUIRE_AUTH`; `get_article` is
  auth-exempt by design (App Check + IP rate limit only);
  `backfill_related_links` lacks `_require_admin`. Details + required
  pre-flip fixes: `NATIVE_AUTH_SETUP.md` §6.
- **2026-07-03 — Consolidation.** Merged all task/handoff/spec/audit docs into
  this file; deleted the superseded seven; verified every claimed-done item
  against code; re-ranked the backlog; rewrote the `/ship` skill (Vercel +
  TestFlight CI, iPhone-PWA step retired); added App Store readiness, cost/API
  strategy, and marketing plan episodes; added `CLAUDE.md` pointing here.
- **2026-07-02 — Phase 2 complete (M10+M12).** Connection insights on the feed +
  weekly synthesis (backend + in-app card). Deploys pending — §4 task 4.
- **2026-07-02 — Phase 2 polish (M11, M16, M-P2/P3/P4), M13/M14/M9 finish, Ask
  header parity, digest settings redesign.**
- **2026-07-01 — Auth cutover code (Batch 2) + production-readiness audit +
  Phase 1 trust fixes (M1–M7) + Google Sign-In Phase 1 (web).**
- **2026-06-30 and earlier** — native iOS app + Share Extension + rebrand to
  Machina, collections + sharing, Ask Machina + streaming + history, curated
  digest, reading view + TTS, browser extension, security baseline. Full detail:
  `git log` and the deleted `HANDOFF.md` in history.
