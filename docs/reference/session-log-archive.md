- **2026-07-05 — Native claim/delete CORS fix + web Apple/Google UI + account
  polish (shipped).** Root-caused the restricted-screen bug from the Apple entry
  below: Firebase **callables fail the CORS preflight from `capacitor://localhost`**,
  so `httpsCallable(claim_workspace)` never reached the function in the WKWebView
  (no execution logs) — the same wall that moved `get_share_config`/`/api/chat`
  off managed paths. Fix: added HTTP twins **`claim_workspace_http` +
  `delete_account_http`** (`@https_fn.on_request`, CORS via `_allowed_origins()`
  incl. `capacitor://localhost`, auth via `_verify_bearer`), sharing
  `_claim_workspace_logic`/`_delete_account_logic` with the callables; native
  routes to them (`/api/claim-workspace`, `/api/delete-account` — `authHeaders()`
  bearer), web keeps the callable. `firebase.json` + `web/vercel.json` rewrites
  added. **Deployed + curl-verified:** both endpoints 401 on no-token and the
  `capacitor://localhost` OPTIONS preflight now returns 204 (the exact call that
  failed before). Also: **web login now offers Continue with Apple + Google** with
  NO auth cutover (`showApple` on web; `REQUIRE_AUTH`/rules unchanged) — the web
  Apple button needs the Apple **Services ID + `.p8`** in the Firebase Apple
  provider to actually work (native didn't). UI: removed the profile-letter avatar
  from the home header (lives in Settings only); Settings → Account shows "Signed
  in with Apple/Google" (from `providerData`) and Sign out moved to its own row so
  the full email isn't truncated. Web live via Vercel; functions + hosting
  deployed; iOS via TestFlight build 1037 (`require_auth=true`). Deferred (needs
  cutover): full brand-new-user claim path (backend `REQUIRE_AUTH` still off).
- **2026-07-05 — Related cards: hide the path you're already on.** Relatedness is
  symmetric, so opening B from A's Related list put A back at the top of B's list
  — redundant, doubly so now the Back arrow returns you there. `getRelatedCards`
  gained an `excludeIds` set (seeds the `used` set); `Feed` passes the current
  `linkStack`. Cards opened fresh from the feed (empty stack) are unchanged, so
  global symmetry holds — only the in-session path is trimmed. Live on web +
  TestFlight build 1036.
- **2026-07-05 — Detail modal: split back vs close.** The related-card back-stack
  had one X that popped a single level, so escaping a deep back-and-forth took
  many taps. Split it: X + backdrop now `closeActiveLinkStack` (dismiss the whole
  stack at once); a new back arrow — shown only when `canGoBack` — steps back one
  card via `goBackOrClose`; iOS edge-swipe-back maps to step-back-one. Live on
  web + TestFlight build 1035.
- **2026-07-05 — Related-card nav opens at the top.** The detail modal reuses a
  single scroll container, so tapping a related card (which sits near the bottom)
  opened the next card still scrolled to the bottom. Added a `scrollRef` + an
  effect that resets `scrollTop = 0` on `link.id` change, so a related card opens
  at the top like a fresh open from the feed. One change, both platforms (iOS is
  the same Capacitor WebView build). Live on web + TestFlight build 1034.
- **2026-07-05 — Connections sharpened to cross-category; inline banner removed.**
  Refined the M10 hybrid after the user noted the flat view overlapped with
  browsing by category. `crossCategoryClusters` (in `lib/connections.ts`) now
  keeps ONLY clusters that bridge 2+ categories — the threads a category filter
  structurally can't reproduce (e.g. a Science card + a Health card sharing
  "Data Interpretation"). Within-category clusters are dropped. The view labels
  each thread with the categories it bridges, rendered as their real colored
  chips (`getCategoryColorStyle`); the toolbar pill count shares the same source.
  Then removed the inline `ConnectionInsight` banner + component entirely — the
  toolbar Connections pill owns this surface now, so the feed no longer carries
  a redundant proactive banner. Dropped the orphaned `bestCluster` helper.
  Web-only; live on `main` via Vercel + TestFlight build.
- **2026-07-05 — Connections view + pill, related-card back-stack, tidy.** Built
  the M10 hybrid the user asked for. (i) Clustering extracted to
  `lib/connections.ts` (shared): the inline feed banner stays strict (≥3,
  strongest only — the proactive moment), while a new `ConnectionsView` + a
  toolbar **Connections** pill (peer to Collections/Ask, with a cluster count,
  shown only when clusters exist) relaxes to ≥2 and lists every concept cluster.
  Desktop renders inline under a back-subheader; mobile is a full-screen overlay,
  mirroring Collections. (ii) **Related-card back-stack** in `Feed.tsx`: opening a
  card from another card's Related list pushes the current one (`linkStack`);
  closing (`goBackOrClose`) returns there instead of dismissing everything.
  Delete is stack-aware. (iii) Related cards: removed the redundant shared-concept
  chips + the generic ✨ icon (the "Also explores …" reason already names them).
  Web-only; live on `main` via Vercel.
- **2026-07-05 — ✅ Apple + Google sign-in VERIFIED on device (build 1033).**
  Finalized native auth on iOS. Ran the iOS→TestFlight workflow with
  `require_auth=true` (first attempt, run #31, died on the Apple **Development
  cert cap** — owner pruned certs at developer.apple.com; a duplicate concurrent
  dispatch was cancelled to avoid re-exhausting the cap; clean run #33 = **build
  1033** uploaded). On device: the Apple/Google login screen shows, **both**
  Continue-with-Apple and Continue-with-Google sign in successfully and load the
  feed, and Settings shows the account + Delete account. Firebase Auth has ONE
  user for morhogeg@gmail.com (`jX2yUZpZtybHuKrAfkCQR0NEzj72`) with BOTH apple.com
  and google.com providers linked (auto-linked by verified email) — so one uid
  covers both methods. **Deployed** `claim_workspace` + `delete_account` (they
  were never on prod — the live backend predated the auth work; deployed from the
  main checkout with flags still OFF, behavior-safe). Backend `REQUIRE_AUTH`/
  `OWNER_EMAIL` remain unset. **Bug found (see task 2/3):** the native app's
  `claim_workspace` CALLABLE call arrives at the function unauthenticated / never
  reaches it (no execution logs; same class of WebView-callable failure that
  already forced share-config off its callable) — so the owner-claim never wrote,
  and the sign-in dead-ended on the restricted screen. **Workaround applied:**
  manually wrote `authUids:[jX2yUZpZtybHuKrAfkCQR0NEzj72]` + `email` onto
  `users/+16462440305` via the Admin SDK (exactly what the owner-claim does),
  which unblocked device sign-in. A proper fix (route claim through an HTTP
  endpoint with the `capacitor://localhost` CORS allowlist + bearer verify, like
  `/api/chat`) shipped the same session — **see the entry above.**
- **2026-07-05 — Connection insight recoverable + related-card contrast.** Two
  home/detail polish fixes. (i) `ConnectionInsight`: the X used to permanently
  blocklist the concept (localStorage, survived refresh) with no re-entry — an
  accidental close was unrecoverable. Now X *minimizes* the banner to a small
  persistent pill in the same feed slot; tap it to restore. Collapsed state
  persists (`connection-insight-collapsed`) so it also won't re-nag; removed the
  per-concept blocklist entirely. (ii) `LinkDetailModal` related cards used
  hardcoded `white/5`·`black/20` alphas that were near-invisible on the light
  modal panel — swapped to theme tokens (`bg-card-hover` over the `bg-card`
  panel + `border-border-subtle` + `shadow-sm`), matching the Ask-tab citation
  cards. Web-only; live on `main` via Vercel.
- **2026-07-05 — Analyzing banner: phase-based label.** The page-level banner
  showed a static "Analyzing link"; now its label advances with progress,
  mirroring the in-panel scan views (`phaseLabel(kind, pct)` in
  `AnalyzingBanner.tsx`): link → Fetching → Reading the page → Understanding →
  Writing summary → Organizing & tagging; image → Scanning → Reading text →
  Understanding → Organizing → Finishing up; video → Watching → Understanding →
  Writing → Organizing; done → "Saved to Machina". Applies to both the in-app
  add flow and shares from other apps. Live on web via `main`; a TestFlight
  build was triggered on push (build number = 1000 + run number).
- **2026-07-05 — Related cards: recall→precision, final (build 1028).** Chased
  this across three commits. (i) Root bug: `getRelatedCards` used an if/else so
  when a card had ANY embedding it took ONLY the semantic path — a moderate
  embedding score vetoed genuine topical matches. (ii) First fix went too loose
  (same-category + a shared broad tag → every Health card related). (iii) Final:
  relatedness requires a SPECIFIC signal — embedding sim ≥ 0.80, or ≥ 0.74 + a
  shared **concept**, or ≥ 2 shared **concepts** (concepts are granular; broad
  category/tags no longer qualify, only tie-break ranking). Concept path stays
  precise even if embeddings are unreadable. Unit-tested both directions (sun
  pair relates; sun vs unrelated Health card does not). The loose "additive"
  version (c25c9a2) built as run #27 but was **intentionally not merged**. Build
  1028 green; live on web via this merge.
- **2026-07-05 — Desktop banner de-dup (build 1026).** On desktop the open Add
  panel shows its own scan %, so the page-level Analyzing banner was duplicating
  it; now suppressed while the panel is expanded on desktop (`!isMobile &&
  isExpanded`), appears on close, rides to completion. Mobile unchanged. Build
  1026 green (tripwire passed) — carries this + the rebuild button below.
- **2026-07-05 — One-tap "Rebuild connections" (backfill See-also for old
  cards).** The client related-cards fix only helps cards that have embeddings;
  pre-pipeline cards have none. New batched, per-user backfill:
  `graph_service.backfill_batch` + `rebuild_connections` callable (embed phase
  then relate phase, paginated so a big library can't hit the callable
  timeout), driven by `web/lib/rebuildConnections.ts` from a **Settings →
  Connections → Rebuild** button with live progress. No admin token (scoped to
  the caller's workspace), idempotent. **Requires one `./deploy-functions.sh`**
  by the owner to publish the callable (bundles with the pending M12 deploy);
  then it's a tap. Ships in build 1024 / web. py_compile + tsc clean.
- **2026-07-05 — Analyzing banner (both capture paths) + related-cards fix —
  build 1023.** (1) The in-flight "Analyzing… N%" indicator was trapped inside
  AddLinkForm (vanished when the sheet closed); lifted to a page-level
  `AnalyzingBanner`. (2) Extended it to **shares from other apps / WhatsApp**
  (the priority): those analyze server-side, so `useProcessingBanner` watches
  the `status:'processing'` cards the feed already streams and synthesizes an
  eased % that flips to "Saved" when the card resolves. page.tsx merges the two
  sources into one banner. (3) Restored the save **percentage** in all scan
  views (build 1021). (4) **Related cards:** same-category now counts as a
  corroborating signal in `related.ts` (two clearly-related same-category cards
  in the 0.74–0.80 band were being dropped). Note: OLD cards without embeddings
  still need the M9 backfill (§4 task 4) for stored relations. All browser/unit
  verified. Build 1023 green (entitlement tripwire passed).
- **2026-07-05 — ✅ Build 1021 CONFIRMED working on device** (user verified:
  "share is working very well," save flow good). This is the current good
  TestFlight build. Below is how it got there:
- **2026-07-05 — Share bridge hardened (share STILL failed on 1020) + % restored.**
  Entitlements were verified in 1020, so the failure is the token never being
  written — the bridge's single dependency was the `get_share_config` callable.
  Rewrite (`web/lib/shareConfig.ts`): the ingest token now comes straight off
  the already-loaded user doc (no backend call at all; callable is only a
  first-launch fallback), 3 retries with backoff, auto re-sync on
  app-foreground, and every outcome recorded to a new **Settings → Share
  extension status row** with a Fix button — the next failure diagnoses itself.
  Also restored the advancing percentage (user request; reverses M6's
  no-numbers stance): % readout + determinate bar in all three scan views and
  the minimized "Analyzing… N%" chip, still anchored to the real milestones.
  If saves from the native app fail IN-APP too, check the functions env for
  `APPCHECK_ENFORCE=true`/`REQUIRE_AUTH=true` — native can't pass App Check
  yet; those must stay unset until cutover.
- **2026-07-04 — ✅ Build 1020: share extension fixed, tripwire-verified — the
  build to install.** Owner pruned the API-created Development certificates;
  run #20 signed the archive properly (App Group entitlement baked in), the
  new CI tripwire confirmed the entitlement in BOTH the app and ShareExt
  binaries before upload, and 1020 shipped with everything: working share,
  related cards, scrubbed header fade (late-mount fix), softened delete copy.
  Builds 1014–1019 are superseded/broken — do not use.
- **2026-07-04 — ⚠️ Build 1018 REGRESSION: Share Extension broken.** The
  unsigned-archive signing workaround lost the App Group entitlement — every
  share fails with "Open Machina and sign in first" on 1018. Fixed in CI:
  reverted to signed archives + added an IPA entitlement tripwire (App Group
  must be present in app + extension or the run fails before upload). §2
  gotcha rewritten accordingly. **Next build is blocked until the owner prunes
  Apple Development certificates** (developer.apple.com → Certificates — the
  cert cap from runs #15/#16 still stands). Until then, roll back to
  **build 1013** in TestFlight (share works there; it lacks only related-cards
  + the fade late-mount fix). Related-cards on OLD saves is separate and not a
  bug: they need the M9 backfill (§4 task 4 — set `ADMIN_TOKEN`, deploy
  functions, run the admin curl); new saves relate immediately.
- **2026-07-04 — Two-session race + Apple cert-cap outage; build 1018 is the
  definitive merged build.** Two parallel sessions pushed builds minutes apart:
  run #14 (build 1014, other session's related-cards branch) and #15 (this
  session's header-fade fix) — no build-number collision (run numbers are
  unique), but neither contained both changes. Merged `main` into this branch →
  the combined build. Then #15/#16 failed on **Apple's certificate cap**: with
  automatic signing, every ephemeral runner mints a new Development cert at
  archive; 14 runs exhausted the quota. #17 (global Distribution override)
  failed — it leaks onto SPM targets. **Fix that stuck (run #18, build 1018):
  unsigned archive + one-time distribution signing at export** (see the new §2
  gotcha). Also in 1018: the header-fade **late-mount fix** — the scrub never
  attached because the header mounts after the auth loading screen; the hook
  now uses a callback ref (Chromium-verified: opacity 1 → 0.77 mid-scrub → 0
  settled → 1 on return). **Install 1018; ignore 1014–1017.** Merged to `main`.
- **2026-07-04 — Related cards go live (open-card view).** The open card's
  "See Also" section was a frozen save-time snapshot: old cards never learned
  about newer related saves, and pre-graph cards showed nothing (plus a dead
  client heuristic that was computed but never rendered). New `web/lib/related.ts`
  merges the stored LLM-verified relations (curated reasons, ranked first) with
  **live client-side matches** — cosine over the in-memory `embedding_vector`s
  (normalizes both plain-array and Firestore `VectorValue` storage), corroborated
  by shared concepts/tags — each with a deterministic "why" sentence ("Also
  explores X and Y", RTL variants included). No model call, no cost. Section
  renamed "Related cards", capped at 4, every entry navigates (dead links drop
  out). Kept inline (not behind a button): it's already below the fold, and the
  graph is the product's hero. Shipped: web via `main`; iOS via TestFlight run
  #14 (green, **build 1014** — triggered with the temporary-push-trigger
  pattern; API dispatch is 403 from remote sessions).
- **2026-07-03 — Header fade + calmer delete copy.** The home top bar now does
  a **scroll-scrubbed fade** (`web/lib/useHeaderFade.ts`): a progress value
  rides the actual scroll travel (~140px down = fully away, ~80px up = fully
  back), styles written per rAF frame via ref (no re-renders), with a 160ms
  idle settle to the nearest endpoint on `--ease-modal`, top-lock, rubber-band
  clamp, reduced-motion fallback, and an always-on status-bar scrim so content
  never scrolls naked under the notch. First iteration (binary toggle, build
  1012) read as a pop — replaced by the scrubbed version in **build 1013**.
  Delete-dialog copy softened again per feedback: "It'll be removed from your
  Machina, along with its summary and connections." Live on web via `main`.
- **2026-07-03 — Delete flow: one confirm, warmer copy.** Deleting from an open
  card showed two stacked confirms (the detail modal's generic dialog, then the
  Feed's branded one). The modal's own dialog was removed — Delete routes
  straight to the Feed's branded confirm (stacks above the card; Cancel returns
  to it). Single + bulk microcopy rewritten: "Delete this card? / It comes out
  of your Machina completely — summary, tags, and connections included. There's
  no undo." TestFlight build 1011; live on web via `main`.
- **2026-07-03 — List view: per-language mirroring + full-width titles.** Two
  rounds from user feedback. (1) `ListCard` rows now set `dir` per card, so
  Hebrew cards mirror completely (colour bar/chip/star on the correct sides;
  RTL detection unified through `getDirection`); titles clamp at 3 lines (was
  2) — TestFlight build 1009. (2) Layout redesign: the category chip left the
  title row (it squeezed long titles) and joined the metadata line as a compact
  truncating pill (icon · source · chip); title spans the full row; star keeps
  its 44px target, top-aligned — build 1010, **screenshot-verified** (real
  Chromium renders, EN+HE fixtures, dark+light, via a throwaway `/dev-listcard`
  harness removed before commit). Both live on web via `main`.
- **2026-07-03 — P1 pack CI-verified + shipped (multi-agent session).** All
  automatable P1 items done in one round (three agents, entries below): AI
  consent (task 6), privacy manifests wired + iPhone-only (task 7 + half of 9),
  legal pages + App Store pack (task 8 + doc half of 9). **CI run #8 green —
  build 1008 uploaded to TestFlight** with the wired manifests and
  `TARGETED_DEVICE_FAMILY = 1`; merged to `main` (Vercel deployed `/privacy`,
  `/terms`, and the consent screen to the web). Remaining P1 is owner-only:
  device sweep (task 11), reviewer demo account + screenshots + clicking the
  Connect forms from `docs/APP_STORE.md`.
- **2026-07-03 — Legal pages + App Store pack (§4 task 8 + doc half of 9).**
  Hosted Privacy Policy and Terms shipped as static pages
  (`web/app/privacy/page.tsx`, `web/app/terms/page.tsx` — prose column, theme
  tokens, content verified against `delete_account`/share-page/processor
  reality; governing-law jurisdiction left as an explicit placeholder). New
  `web/lib/publicRoutes.tsx` + a two-line `app/layout.tsx` change make
  `/privacy` and `/terms` reachable signed-out (AuthProvider otherwise swaps
  every route for the LoginScreen after hydration — App Review must be able to
  read the policy URL). `docs/APP_STORE.md` added: nutrition-label
  declarations with justifications (tracking = NO; Usage Data/Diagnostics =
  none; phone number deliberately not declared — collected outside the app,
  covered in the policy), full metadata drafts, review-notes template, and the
  6-shot screenshot list. §4 tasks 8/9 statuses updated. tsc clean. Remaining
  manual: Connect forms, demo account, screenshots.
- **2026-07-03 — AI-consent disclosure (§4 task 6).** First-run consent gate
  `AIConsentNotice.tsx` naming Google Gemini, rendered from `AuthProvider` on
  both native (pre-cutover, no sign-in needed) and web, after the sign-in gate
  and before `Onboarding`/the tour; acceptance in localStorage `ai-consent-v1`
  + mirrored `aiConsentAt` on the user doc (either signal suppresses re-ask;
  helpers in `web/lib/aiConsent.ts`); Settings gained an "AI & privacy"
  section (provider line, consent date, Privacy Policy/Terms links via new
  `policyUrl`/`openExternal` in `web/lib/share.ts` — external Safari open
  under Capacitor, Vercel origin). tsc clean. Device verification pending.
- **2026-07-03 — Top-3 blockers finished + CI-verified (multi-agent session).**
  (1) Native-auth build FIXED and proven: root cause was the Xcode 16 toolchain
  stripping Capacitor's feature-gated symbols, not a dependency conflict — CI
  moved to macos-26/Xcode 26, plugin strip removed, and **run #7 archived +
  uploaded build 1007 to TestFlight with all three native plugins**. (2) Cutover
  prep: locked rules corrected (a `users` read rule that would have bricked
  sign-in; `syntheses` added), rules test suite in `firestore-rules-test/`,
  `retryFailedLink` bearer header, `backfill_related_links` admin-gated.
  (3) New-user path + onboarding (entry below). Merged to `main`. Next: install
  build 1007, verify Apple/Google sign-in on device, then the §4 task-2 cutover.
- **2026-07-03 — New-user path (§4 task 3).** `claim_workspace` extended:
  claim (OWNER_EMAIL-gated) → create-fresh-workspace fallback
  (`link_service.create_workspace`, doc ID = Firebase Auth uid, default
  settings + ingest token, `onboarded: false`); returns `created` so the
  client shows the new one-screen `Onboarding.tsx` welcome (capture surfaces +
  "Start saving"). Restricted screen kept only for failures, now with Retry.
  Fully flag-gated: with `REQUIRE_AUTH` off nothing changes live.
- **2026-07-03 — Auth-cutover readiness (code side of §4 task 2).** Brought
  `firestore.rules.locked` up to date: added the missing `syntheses` rule
  (client read-only), rewrote the `users/{uid}` read rule to be
  `resource.data.authUids`-based (the old `owns(uid)` `get()` can't run in a
  *list* rule, so it would have rejected the workspace-resolve query and
  bricked every sign-in at cutover), denied client create/delete on user docs.
  Added `firestore-rules-test/` (rules-unit-testing suite + README; couldn't
  run in the cloud session — emulator JAR download blocked — run it on the
  owner machine). Flag audit: `retryFailedLink` (web/lib/storage.ts) misses
  `authHeaders()` → card Retry 401s under `REQUIRE_AUTH`; `get_article` is
  auth-exempt by design (App Check + IP rate limit only);
  `backfill_related_links` lacks `_require_admin`. Details + required
  pre-flip fixes: `NATIVE_AUTH_SETUP.md` §6.
- **2026-07-03 — Consolidation.** Merged all task/handoff/spec/audit docs into
  this file; deleted the superseded seven; verified every claimed-done item
  against code; re-ranked the backlog; rewrote the `/ship` skill (Vercel +
  TestFlight CI, iPhone-PWA step retired); added App Store readiness, cost/API
  strategy, and marketing plan episodes; added `CLAUDE.md` pointing here.
- **2026-07-02 — Phase 2 complete (M10+M12).** Connection insights on the feed +
  weekly synthesis (backend + in-app card). Deploys pending — §4 task 4.
- **2026-07-02 — Phase 2 polish (M11, M16, M-P2/P3/P4), M13/M14/M9 finish, Ask
  header parity, digest settings redesign.**
- **2026-07-01 — Auth cutover code (Batch 2) + production-readiness audit +
  Phase 1 trust fixes (M1–M7) + Google Sign-In Phase 1 (web).**
- **2026-06-30 and earlier** — native iOS app + Share Extension + rebrand to
  Machina, collections + sharing, Ask Machina + streaming + history, curated
  digest, reading view + TTS, browser extension, security baseline. Full detail:
  `git log` and the deleted `HANDOFF.md` in history.
