## 6. Episode 1 — Codebase readiness for App Store iOS submission (reviewed 2026-07-03)

The engineering fundamentals are in better shape than most first submissions: the
audit's hard blockers were all addressed in code — in-app account deletion
(Guideline 5.1.1(v)) exists as a `delete_account` callable with a confirm flow,
Sign in with Apple ships alongside Google (Guideline 4.8), privacy manifest files
with the correct `CA92.1` UserDefaults declarations exist for both the app and the
Share Extension (the post-2024 auto-rejection trap), `ITSAppUsesNonExemptEncryption`
is set, ATS is clean, there's no tracking SDK (so no ATT prompt needed), and the
app comfortably clears Guideline 4.2 "minimum functionality" — a native share
extension, haptics, and real offline-tolerant plumbing make it feel like an app,
not a wrapped website. The genuine gap between today and a submittable build is
concentrated in one place: **auth isn't live**. The store build must be the one
where `REQUIRE_AUTH` is on, Firestore rules are locked, and a reviewer can create
a fresh account — because a reviewer landing in the current shared single-user
workspace (or on a "restricted access" screen) is an instant rejection, and
world-writable rules on a public app are a data breach, not a finding.

Beyond auth, current-cycle guideline changes add three items the older audit
predates. First, Apple's **AI transparency enforcement (November 2025)**: an app
that sends personal data to a third-party AI service must disclose the provider
and obtain explicit consent — Machina sends saved content, images, and questions
to Google Gemini, so a first-run consent notice plus a privacy-policy section
naming Gemini is now table stakes. Second, the **SDK floor**: since April 2026
submissions must be built against the current-generation SDK, and the CI pins
`Xcode_16*` on `macos-14` — bump the runner before the store submission even
though TestFlight accepted the July 2 build. Third, review logistics: a **demo
account** in App Review notes, an explanation that WhatsApp capture requires an
external Twilio number (so the reviewer doesn't fail it as broken), a hosted
**privacy policy + support URL**, the App Privacy nutrition label matching
Firebase + Google Sign-In data collection, and either iPad screenshots or flipping
`TARGETED_DEVICE_FAMILY` from `"1,2"` to iPhone-only (recommended — the UI is
phone-first). None of these are engineering-heavy; they are a focused week once
the auth build is green. Realistic sequence: CI plugin fix → cutover → consent
screen + policy URLs → device pass (§4 task 11) → submit.
