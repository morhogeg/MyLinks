## 7. Episode 2 — Cost, API keys, and the user journey

**Do not ask users for an API key.** BYO-key is the single worst option for this
product: it filters the audience down to developers, adds a brutal first-run
(sign up at Google AI Studio before saving your first link?), creates support
burden, and — because the key would have to live client-side or per-user
server-side — weakens the security posture the audit worked to fix. The key stays
where it is today: **server-side only, in Cloud Functions env**, never in the
bundle (the client-side Gemini path was already deleted for exactly this reason).
The economics support this: analysis runs on `gemini-3.1-flash-lite`, one of the
cheapest capable models — a typical save (scrape + structured analysis + embedding
+ graph check) costs a fraction of a cent, and even a heavy user (300 saves + 100
asks + digests/syntheses a month) lands in the range of **$0.10–$0.50/month** in
model cost plus Firebase's mostly-free tier. Cost is not the constraint; **abuse**
is. The real protections are already designed: verified auth on every paid
endpoint (task 2), App Check enforcement, and per-uid rate limits (task 13) — plus
GCP budget alerts (task 19) so a surprise never compounds.

**Recommended course: launch free with invisible guardrails, monetize with a
simple subscription only after retention proves itself.** Concretely: (1) at
launch, everything free with generous soft caps enforced server-side (e.g. ~150
saves and ~100 asks/month — above what an engaged user hits, so nobody ever sees
the limit in month one); (2) when there's evidence people return (the weekly
synthesis and digest are the retention signals to watch), introduce **Machina
Pro** via Apple In-App Purchase at ~$3.99/month or $29/year — unlimited saves and
asks, weekly synthesis, voice ask when it ships, priority analysis — keeping the
free tier genuinely useful (the free tier IS the marketing); (3) never gate
capture — a save that bounces off a paywall destroys the "I can trust this caught
it" promise the whole product stands on; gate the expensive *intelligence*
(unlimited Ask, synthesis) instead. Use Apple IAP/StoreKit rather than external
purchase links at this scale: the 15% small-business rate costs less than the
conversion you'd lose sending iOS users to a web checkout, and it keeps review
friction near zero. On the user's side of the ledger the journey is: install →
sign in with Apple → consent to AI processing → save two things from the share
sheet → magic, with zero setup and zero payment wall — convenience first, and the
costs it creates for you are cents, bounded, and observable.
